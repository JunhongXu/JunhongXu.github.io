## About Me

I obtained my PhD from Indiana University, where my research centered on safe decision-making under uncertainty for
real-world robotic systems.
My research interest is designing methods that enhance the **safety (avoid undesirable states)** and
**efficiency (accomplish tasks with the least amount of time/resources)** of robotic systems at
**deployment time**.
To achieve this goal, during my doctoral research, I focused on leveraging model uncertainty to improve deployment time
robustness. I utilized potential model inaccuracies to develop planning algorithms that adopt conservative behaviors in
high-uncertainty regions.
Towards the end of my PhD, I also worked on generating diverse and trainable environments for reinforcement learning,
aiming for deployment time generalization over environment distributions.

After graduation, I joined Nuro.ai, working on safe reinforcement learning methods and generative models for addressing challenging, safety-critical
decision-making and planning problems in the realm of self-driving vehicles.

Prior to my Ph.D., I also worked on [reducing DAgger's manual labeling in imitation learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvOjQcOTBvU&t=55s&ab_channel=JunhongXu) and [multi-task imitation learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04503) for mobile robot navigation in indoor environments.
