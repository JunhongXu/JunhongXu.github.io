## About Me

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at Vehicle Autonomy and Intelligence Lab at Indiana University, Bloomington.
My research focuses on decision-making under uncertainty for real-world robotic applications.
I am particularly interested in developing practical and scalable decision-making algorithms that consider the following commonly existing uncertainties in real-world robotic systems:

1. **motion outcome uncertainty**, where the robot cannot accurately predict its motion outcome after executing a control command,

2. **interaction uncertainty**, where the behaviors of other interacting agents are uncertain,

3. **state uncertainty**, where the physical state of the robot cannot be accurately determined (e.g., localization error),

4. **perception uncertainty**, where the outcome of a perception model is uncertain (e.g., pixel-wise uncertainty in semantic segmentation).

Prior to my Ph.D., I also worked on [reducing DAgger's manual labeling in imitation learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvOjQcOTBvU&t=55s&ab_channel=JunhongXu) and [multi-task imitation learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04503) for mobile robot navigation in indoor environments.
