Planning and control of an autonomous vehicle in extreme off-road environments pose many challenges due to the presence
of highly uncertain interactions between the robot and the environment.
Our team is 1 of 4 teams selected (others are MIT, CMU and University of Washington) by the Army Research Laboratory
(ARL) to enhance unmanned ground vehicle's navigation and control capability in off-road environments.

We have successfully deployed our stochastic motion planner based on our previous works to various off-road
environments.
This work has been published to the International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR) <a
